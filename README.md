beatsense
=========

beatsense is my first Windows Phone 8.0 application. What I first started out like a metronome was eventually built into a full virtual beat maker.

This was built using VS Express for Windows Phone. Used the standard set of technology C# and XAML.

The app is still in working, and there is a known issue when the app stops after refreshing the beat 2-3 times.

Here's a an attempt to be humourous and show the application's usage: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x35eMspq9yM
